                <p class="content">I'm a late bloomer when it comes to tech. Decided to go back to school at 32 to get my Associates in Computer Science from Kingsborough Community College in New York City. After that I completed an intensive web development bootcamp program at Fullstack Academy. I then completed an unpaid intership at ForwardLane. Build a small web application for Estee Lauder and now I am working as a QA Analyst for Switchfly in San Francisco.
