                <p class="content">I'm a late bloomer when it comes to tech. Decided to go back to school at 32 to get my Associates in Computer Science from Kingsborough Community College in New York City. After that I completed an intensive web development bootcamp program at Fullstack Academy. I then completed an unpaid intership at ForwardLane. Built a small web application for Estee Lauder. Began working in Quality Assurance at Switchfly in San Francisco. Currently now working for CBS Interactive as Video Quality Assurance Analysist.
